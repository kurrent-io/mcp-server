# Contributing to KurrentDB MCP Server

## Working with the Git

We use `master` as the main development branch.
We do our best to ensure a clean history. To do so, commits are automatically squashed into a single logical commit when pull requests are merged.

**To contribute to KurrentDB**:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from the `master` (or release) branch.
3. It's recommended that feature branches use a rebase strategy (see more in [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)). We also highly recommend using clear commit messages that represent the unit of change.
4. Rebase the latest source branch from the main repository before sending PR.
5. When ready to create the Pull Request on GitHub [check to see what has previously changed](https://github.com/kurrent-io/mcp-server/compare).
